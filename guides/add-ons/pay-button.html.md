Creating a credit card form and integrating it into your site can be a time consuming exercise. To make life easier, we've created the PAYMILL PayButton.

The PayButton makes integrating a payment form into your website much easier.

<div class="important">
  The **PayButton has been deprecated**. It still works in Live Mode for existing users but **any new integration should be avoided**.
  <br>
  You can still find the old reference for the **PayButton** [here](https://developers-v1.paymill.com/en/add-ons/paybutton/).
</div>
