## Store a payment method through payment object

A payment object is an object generated by the PAYMILL API. The nonsensitive parts of the payment data of your clients are stored here. You can use them to create transactions or for documentation purposes.

<p class="important">
**Requirements:**
You have an account. (You can register here).
Use of the API: You have authenticated yourself.
</p>

## 1. Create client

In order to store the credit card data of a client, you must create his profile first.

On the homepage, go to **Clients** and click **New client**

<p class="important">
**Important:**
In the created payment object, the nonsensitive parts of the payment data of your clients are now stored. For all subsequent transactions and subscriptions, only the payment object is needed.
</p>


## 3. Validity of the payment method


**LIVE mode**
If no transaction is yet to be created with the payment object, the payment method is not yet valid. With the help of a preauthorization, you can validate your payment method without having to carry out a transaction. The preauthorization should occur within half a day of creating the payment object (if no transaction has occurred yet with this payment method).

A preauthorization of your payment object is only possible over the API.

## 4. Create a payment

Create a new transaction with one of the payment types that are assigned to your client.

On the detail page of your **client**, you can now create a new transaction by clicking on **Create transaction** in the **Transactions** section. If you have created several payment methods, they are made available for you to select from under **Payment type**.
